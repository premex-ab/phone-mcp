Phone MCP turns your Android device into a server that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This allows AI agents that are MCP-compatible to securely interact with selected phone capabilities.

The app does not include or run any AI models itself. It simply enables communication between external AI systems and your phone's features — under your control.

Current Features
- Access to contact list (read-only)
- Send SMS messages through the system messaging app

These actions require explicit permission from the user and are only available when actively granted.

How It Works
- Install and open Phone MCP
- Start the MCP server from the app
- Connect to the server from an external MCP-compatible AI agent
- Select which features the agent is allowed to use

No action is taken without the user's involvement. All access is local and protected by Android's permission model.

Designed For
- Developers building or testing MCP-compatible AI agents
- Users running personal AI systems or interpreters on external machines
- Anyone looking to extend AI interaction to their phone in a secure, structured way

Privacy and Data
- No user data is collected or shared
- No telemetry or background analytics
- No cloud dependencies — everything runs locally

Access is always permission-based and clearly indicated

Note that this is an early version of Phone MCP. Future updates may include additional optional features like location access, camera, and more — all with strict opt-in controls.
