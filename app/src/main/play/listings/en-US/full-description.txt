📱 Turn Your Phone Into an AI Assistant's Tool

Phone MCP transforms your Android device into a secure server that connects AI assistants to your phone's capabilities. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), it enables powerful AI interactions while keeping your data completely under your control.

Unlike AI apps that run models on your phone, Phone MCP is a lightweight bridge — it has no AI built-in. Instead, it safely exposes phone features to external MCP-compatible AI systems through a secure, permission-based interface.

🔒 Complete Privacy & Security

Your privacy is paramount:
• Android permission model for all actions
• Explicit user consent required for each feature
• Bearer token authentication for secure connections
• Open source for complete transparency
• All phone data access is local and device-only
• Anonymous app usage analytics only (Firebase) - no personal data shared

For detailed information about what data we collect and how it's used, please review our privacy policy (link available in the Play Console).

✨ Current Capabilities

• 📞 Contact Management: Read and access your contact list (read-only)
• 💬 SMS Control: Send messages through the system app (not available on play store version)
• 💬 SMS Intent: Send SMS via Intent (no special permissions needed)
• 📹 Camera Access: Take and capture photos
• 📡 Sensor Data: Access accelerometer, gyroscope, and other sensors
• 🔌 External Tools: Auto-discover and integrate MCP tools from other apps

All features are opt-in and require explicit permission before use.

🚀 Quick Setup

1. Install Phone MCP on your Android device
2. Open the app and review available tools
3. Enable the features you want to allow
4. Start the MCP server
5. Connect from your external AI agent using the provided connection details
6. Your AI assistant now has controlled access to your phone

Perfect For:
• Developers testing MCP-compatible AI agents
• Users running local AI systems or interpreters
• Anyone wanting secure, permission-based AI phone control
• Building custom AI workflows with phone automation

⚙️ How It Works

Phone MCP acts as a middleman:
1. Your external AI system connects via a secure SSE connection
2. You select which phone capabilities are available
3. All requests are processed locally on your device
4. Nothing happens without your permission
